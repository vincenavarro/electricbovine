## Features

Electric Bovine is a very small chat bot using [DiscordJS](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). Much like the creamer packets at iHop it is intended to be single-serve. The arbitrary list below reflects the whimsical thoughts of the cow.

### Current âš¡

* `!ping` Roundtrip time between bot and server.

### Planned ðŸ”Œ

* Announces when the configured Twitch streams have gone live to the requested channel.
* `!help` Help/Commmands list
* `!roll` Rolls (1d6, 2d10, etc)
* `!kill` Disables bot restricted to Admin users.
* `!file` file request
* `!cow` or `!moo` posts a cow gif
* `!smut` Writes a 50shades adlib

## Install and Run

Electric Bovine requires a config.json. Click [here](config.json.example) to see an example. If you need a developer token you can get one at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) or [Twitch Developers](https://dev.twitch.tv/).

Then clone and run the script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[USER]/electricbovine.git
cd electricbovine
mv ~/config.json config.json # or create it at this time.
yarn
node index.js >> electricbovine.log 2>&1 & # run in background and records to .log, assuming node is in $PATH.
```

Then add the bot to your server using the OAUTH2 URL GENERATOR on the Discord Developer Portal.

## Use

Use the `!` prefix to use a command. Use `!help` or `!command` to see a list of [all commands](#current).

## Pull Request

That really seems like a mistake, but if you insist all suggestions and bug fixes are welcome. This is a personal project so I'll only be adding what I'll use. Feel free to fork it your own use.
